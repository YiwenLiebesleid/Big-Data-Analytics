# Meta-learning and Few-shot Learning

### Goal

In project 2, we were given a bunch of drivers and their trajectories to build a model to classify which driver a given trajectory belongs to. In this task, however, the trainning data contain 500 drivers and only 5-day trajectories for each driver. In this task, we should use meta-learning and/or few shot learning to build the classification model. The model for each driver can be a binary classification, which takes two trajectories as input and predict whether these two trajectories belongs to the same driver.
